# A Svelte + Native experiment

Not much going on here at the moment. Just messing around with a SPA hosted by a native SwiftUI app + WKWebView, using a custom bridge to handle the Client <-> Server communication.

End goal would be an app I would find useful for myself. Probably yet-another-RSS-app.
